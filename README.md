## Using this project

You'll need the Ionic CLI with support for v2 apps:

```bash
$ npm install -g ionic
```

You'll also need Api keys for [Google Places](https://developers.google.com/places/web-service/get-api-key) & [Open Weather Map](http://openweathermap.org/api) and insert them to `src/app/app.config.ts`.

Then run:

```bash
$ ionic serve
```

More info on this can be found on the Ionic [Getting Started](http://ionicframework.com/docs/v2/getting-started/) page.
